# V6 Improvement Completion Summary - Inertia System and Strict Cleanup Mechanism

**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Version**: V6  
**Core Objective**: Solve pedestrian false recognition and box lingering issues

---

## User-Reported Issues

### Issue Description
When testing with walk.csv and other pedestrian data:
1. **Pedestrian False Recognition** - "Pedestrians walking or running are easily identified as scooters"
2. **Box Lingering** - "Boxes tend to persist in empty spaces where point clouds passed through"
3. **Box Attraction** - Boxes transfer to nearby newly appearing point clouds instead of disappearing
4. **Expectation** - "Boxes should always exist where point clouds are present", needs "inertia system" to prevent jumping

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 1: Pedestrian False Recognition
**V5 State**:
- SR_CENTROID_Y_MIN = 0.90m (theoretically high enough)
- But in is_scooter_rider with strict=False, cy_min drops to 0.72m
- L0 fast lane: v≥4.0 + cy≥0.60 (running pedestrians might satisfy)
- L1 conversion: v≥2.5 + cy≥0.70 (jogging pedestrians might also satisfy)

**Analysis**:
- Pedestrian running speed: 2.0-4.0 m/s (slow jog 1.8-2.7, fast run up to 4-5)
- Pedestrian centroid height: 0.3-0.6m (relative to radar 0.45m installation height)
- Scooter+rider centroid: 0.8-1.5m
- cy≥0.60 and cy≥0.70 thresholds too low, cannot distinguish fast-running pedestrians

#### Issue 2: Box Lingering
**V5 State**:
- MAX_MISS = 8 frames (0.8 seconds)
- MAX_MISS_SR = 12 frames (1.2 seconds)
- LATCH mechanism further extends display

**Analysis**:
- After point cloud disappears, boxes can still exist 0.8-1.2 seconds
- For walk.csv pure pedestrian data, boxes shouldn't persist long
- AAA_Final uses smaller miss thresholds, faster cleanup

#### Issue 3: Box Attraction (Most Serious)
**V5 State**:
- ASSOC_GATE_BASE_M = 3.0m (very large)
- Lacks motion direction constraints
- Trajectories can associate to any point cloud within 3 meters

**Analysis**:
- Without inertia constraints, trajectories don't follow historical motion direction
- When target A disappears and target B appears nearby, A's trajectory "attracts" to B
- Violates physical common sense: objects should move along inertia direction
- AAA_Final uses 2.4m gate, more strict

## V6 Solution

### Core Principle
**Borrow AAA_Final's Conservative Strategy**:
- Smaller association gate
- Faster cleanup mechanism
- Uncomplicated conversion logic
- Strict geometric constraints

**New Inertia Physical Constraints**:
- Trajectories must follow historical motion direction
- Prevent jumps that violate physical laws

### Solution 1: Inertia System (Core Innovation)

#### 1.1 Add Inertia Validation Function
```python
def validate_inertia(track, new_cx, new_cz, dt):
    """
    Inertia validation: new position must be consistent with historical motion direction
    
    Checks:
    1. Direction consistency: angle deviation <60 degrees
    2. Prediction error: deviation from predicted position <2x allowable range
    
    Returns: (is_valid, inertia_score)
    """
```

**Implementation Logic**:
1. Calculate average motion vector from last 3 frames (velocity and direction)
2. Predict next frame position: `pred = current + velocity × dt`
3. Check deviation between new position and predicted position
4. Check angle difference between new direction and historical direction
5. **Rejection Conditions**:
   - Angle >90° (reverse motion) → Reject
   - Prediction error >2x allowable value → Reject

**Parameters**:
```python
INERTIA_MIN_HISTORY = 3       # Minimum 3 frames history
INERTIA_ANGLE_THRESHOLD = 0.5 # cos(60°)
INERTIA_ERROR_FACTOR = 2.0    # Prediction error tolerance
INERTIA_MIN_SPEED = 0.5       # Low speed doesn't check direction
```

#### 1.2 Association Logic Integration
Add to ScooterRider association:
```python
if best is not None:
    cx, cz = best["centroid_xz"]
    
    # Inertia validation
    inertia_valid, inertia_score = validate_inertia(sr, cx, cz, dt_med)
    
    if not inertia_valid:
        print(f"  [INERTIA-REJECT] SR#{sr.id} inertia check failed")
        best = None  # Reject association
    else:
        # Continue other validations
        ...
```

**Effect**:
- Trajectories won't jump to point clouds inconsistent with motion direction
- Even within gate, rejected by inertia system
- Conforms to physical intuition: objects move along inertia direction

### Solution 2: Reduce Association Gate

#### Modification
```python
# Before:
ASSOC_GATE_BASE_M = 3.0  # Too large

# After:
ASSOC_GATE_BASE_M = 2.0  # Consistent with AAA_Final
```

**Effect**:
- Limit association range, reduce false associations
- Combined with inertia system, double protection

### Solution 3: Faster Cleanup

#### Modification
```python
# Before:
MAX_MISS = 8           # 0.8 seconds
MAX_MISS_SR = 12       # 1.2 seconds

# After:
MAX_MISS = 3           # 0.3 seconds
MAX_MISS_SR = 5        # 0.5 seconds
```

**Effect**:
- Boxes disappear within 0.3-0.5 seconds after point cloud disappears
- Significantly reduce box lingering time
- Closer to real-time feedback

### Solution 4: Point Cloud Existence Mandatory Check

#### 4.1 Add Check Function
```python
def check_points_nearby(track_cx, track_cz, clusters, radius=0.6):
    """
    Check if there are point clouds near trajectory position
    Returns: True=has point cloud, False=no point cloud
    """
    for c in clusters:
        cx, cz = c["centroid_xz"]
        dist = math.sqrt((cx - track_cx)**2 + (cz - track_cz)**2)
        if dist <= radius:
            return True
    return False
```

#### 4.2 Check Before Display
```python
# Before displaying ScooterRider
cx, cz = sr.last()
if not check_points_nearby(cx, cz, clusters, radius=0.8):
    continue  # Skip display
```

**Effect**:
- Boxes only display where point clouds exist
- Even if miss hasn't exceeded limit, no display without point cloud
- Completely solves blank area lingering issue

### Solution 5: Strictify Scooter Judgment

#### 5.1 Unify cy Threshold
```python
# In is_scooter_rider
# Before:
if not strict:
    cy_min = max(SR_CENTROID_Y_MIN * 0.8, 0.70)  # 0.72m
else:
    cy_min = SR_CENTROID_Y_MIN  # 0.90m

# After:
cy_min = SR_CENTROID_Y_MIN  # Uniform 0.90m, no longer lowered
```

#### 5.2 Raise Conversion Thresholds
```python
# L0 fast lane
# Before: v≥4.0 + cy≥0.60
# After: v≥4.5 + cy≥0.90

# L1 high speed
# Before: v≥2.5 + cy≥0.70
# After: v≥3.0 + cy≥0.90

# L2 medium speed
# Before: v≥1.8 + cy≥1.2 + dur≥1.0s
# After: v≥2.0 + cy≥1.0 + dur≥1.5s
```

#### 5.3 Raise Strong Feature Threshold
```python
# Before:
if 0.6 <= cy <= 0.9 and npts >= 5:
    return True

# After:
if 0.8 <= cy <= 1.2 and npts >= 5:
    return True
```

**Effect**:
- Pedestrians (cy<0.6m, v<3.0m/s) won't be converted
- Running pedestrians (v=2-4m/s, cy=0.4-0.6m) don't satisfy cy≥0.90
- Only real scooters (cy>0.8m) will be recognized

## Summary

### V6 Improvement Essence
**From "Tolerant Tracking" to "Strict Validation"**:
- V1-V5: Try not to lose targets (loose association, extended retention)
- V6: Strictly validate every association (inertia constraints, fast cleanup)

**Design Philosophy Shift**:
- Before: Worried miss causes tracking interruption → relax gate, extend retention
- Now: Worried false positives cause wrong recognition → reduce gate, fast cleanup
- Applicable scenario: walk.csv pure pedestrian data, shouldn't have scooters

### Key Innovations
1. **Inertia System** - Physics constraints prevent unreasonable jumps
2. **Point Cloud Existence Check** - Ensure boxes only where data exists
3. **Unified cy Threshold** - No longer lower standards based on strict
4. **Fast Cleanup** - Clear invalid trajectories within 0.3-0.5 seconds

### Success Criteria
**walk.csv Test**:
- ✅ No scooter boxes appear (orange/red)
- ✅ Pedestrian boxes (green) track normally
- ✅ Boxes disappear immediately after point clouds disappear
- ✅ Boxes don't jump to other positions

**If above conditions met, V6 improvement successful!**
